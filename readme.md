### Create Google Cloud Platform Project

* Create a [Google Cloud Platform Project](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and enable the Google Drive and Google Sheets APIs

# Usage
* To send an email to a new student, add them to the last row of your roster and run the following command in your terminal
```
python3 new_student.py
```
* To send out your weekly email blast, run the following command in your terminal
```
python3 weekly_email.py
```
* To send out your session emails for the following day, run the following command in your terminal
```
python3 session_confirmation.py
```

* When you run the script for the first time, it will ask to send a code to the phone number associated with your iCloud account.
Select your phone number and wait until Apple calls you and gives you the code. **Do not enter the code that was given to you through a push notification. It will not work.**

* The script will automatically adjust the session time to the student's time zone.
